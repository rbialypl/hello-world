# hello-world
A simple test to refresh github use
A little bit about myself;

I graduated from Algoma University in June of 2015 with a Bachelor of Computer Science.

Since then I have worked at a major Steel manufacturer locally in their IT Department where I programmed a project management system using ASP.net MVC (Model View Controller). I am now currently working as a Xerox Service Technician providing service and support for local businesses with their printers.

I managed to secure this position after layoffs from my previous position almost instantly although I have not stopped wanting to pursure a career in programming.

I am starting this github in order to organize my projects and provide my self with easy to manage online-repositories for some of the small projects I have worked on here and there. My ultimate goal is to retain what I have learned and build off of that in order to secure a position as a programmer.

Some of the Projects:

Gladiator Arena: An 8 month project I completed with another partner during our final years at Algoma University. Built in Unity, it is an arena fighting game with AI and Co-op gameplay. Developed in Unity(https://unity3d.com/)

Fruity Game: A project I have been working on slowly where I modify a tutorial provided my Unity Tutorial Projects(https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial). 

Music Library: In order to keep my I had learned from my previous programming position I decided to make an online WEB application for Music. It will basically function as a library with SQL Server in the Backend and using ASP.net MVC framework for the front-end. This is in very early stages.

Additional Details of these projects will be posted once I have them loaded into GIT. For now thank you for taking some time to read about me and my little projects.
